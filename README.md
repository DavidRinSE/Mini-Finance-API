This project was built using Docker containers so it is very easy to get running on your local machine!
Some default enviornment variables have been provided to assist you in development, don't worry these are not the values used in the production app!

### HOW TO RUN LOCALLY
1. Clone this repository and navigate to it's root directory
2. Run `docker-compose up`
